Project description

1. AppointmentCRUD project directory, which implements the simple addition, deletion and editing of patient data in a client-side database.
2. The list of visits reflects the data of all patients who are registered for an appointment.
3. Shedule a visit - plan a patient's visit.
4. Send reminder - the ability to manually send reminders to the patient.
The model (database) is specified in the project, in the absence of this table it is necessary to perform database migrations
Regarding sending email reminders.
A program is running on the server that will monitor the database and record patient dates, compare today's date with the date, and send reminders if a match is found.
Of course, you can set up another monitoring system, it's a simple implementation.
The server side uses the smtp client ("smtp.gmail.com"). 
You will need to insert the sender's email and the recipient's email in the code, this can be done in the SendEmailMessange.cs file.
